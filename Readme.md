#Overview

This project is a website built with Flask. It's all about games, providing details like title, genre, and release date. The data comes from Kaggle, and it's stored using SQLite3. Users can find more info on an About page. While we haven't discussed the design, it likely offers an easy way for users to browse and interact with the game information.

#Code Description


This project has a main folder "python" with a subfolder called "template" where all the HTML files for the website are stored. Inside, there's an About page explaining the website and information about database variables. Another page called Data displays all the information from the dataset. This setup keeps things organized, making it easy for users to explore and understand the website.


#Popular Video Games (Dataset)

The dataset includes details about popular games like when they were released, who made them, how users rated them, and what platforms they're available on. This information gives a clear picture of what games people like, who's making them, and where they can be played. It's useful for studying trends in gaming and understanding what makes a game successful.
